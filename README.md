# Books-app Project

This Books-app is my first application using ReactJs as part of the Udacity's ReactJs Training Course.

# About

This is a single-page app using ReactJs (useState, useEffect, Router), and it represents a virtual bookcase to store your books and track what you're reading. MyReads lets you manage your digital bookshelf.

It is consisted of three shelves:

- Currently Reading
- Want to Read
- Read
- Additionally you can search and add books to any shelf.

# How to install:

- Run `npm install` or `yarn install` in the project directory to install all dependencies.

# Start

To get started developing right away:

- install all project dependencies with `npm install`
- start the development server with `npm start`
- Then it can be viewed in the browser at http://localhost:3000

# Back-end

The backend API is built by Udacity and only a fixed set of search terms are supported.
